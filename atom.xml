      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <div><p>A kill count command was added which can share your kill count with other
players who are also using RuneLite. The client must first observe you
getting a kill count message to record the kill count. It can not read
the kill counts off of the boss log in game yet, but maybe that will come soon.</p>
<p>Note that as the kill count data is sent from the client it is trusted and is not
difficult for someone to fake.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.4.7-Release/kc.png" alt="kc" /></p>
<p>The prayer plugin now can show a prayer bar, below your hitpoints bar, showing
how much prayer you have left.</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <div><p>A lightbox solver plugin was added which tells you the pattern to solve lightboxes after
observing a few of the switches. Contributed by <a href="https://github.com/Adam-">@Adam-</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.4.6-Release/lightboxsolver.png" alt="lightboxsolver" /></p>
<p>A helper for Varrock Museum Quiz was added as well that highlights correct answer to
questions in Varrock Museum basement. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/vikke1234">@vikke1234</a>
who contributed this feature.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.4.6-Release/varrockmuseumsolver.png" alt="varrockmuseumsolver" /></p>
<p>The configuration panel was significantly improved thanks to big contribution from
<a href="https://github.com/takuyakanbr">@takuyakanbr</a>. Some of the improvements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each plugin now has a short description when hovered</li>
<li>Each plugin now has tags that will make plugins easier to search for</li>
<li>Plugins can now be pinned to the top of the panel (a new star icon was added next to each plugin name
that when clicked will pin the config option to top)</li>
<li>Search bar in configuration panel will now always stay on top</li>
<li>Each configuration page for plugins now have back and on/off buttons at the top of panel</li>

<p>Thanks to another awesome contribution from <a href="https://github.com/PandahRS">@PandahRS</a> who spent
a lot of time manually mapping a lot of RuneScape surface to regions, the Discord plugin now has
a lot of new features, including display of <strong>city</strong> you are in, <strong>dungeon</strong> you are currently
exploring, <strong>boss</strong> you are currently fighting and even <strong>minigame</strong> you are currently playing.</p>
<p>Due to privacy reasons, these new location-based features are disabled in any PVP scenario, such
as PVP worlds, High Risk worlds, DMM and Seasonal DMM worlds.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.4.6-Release/discord1.png" alt="discord1" />

<p>In addition to the highlighted features, there have been several other improvements and bugfixes this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>!total, !clues and !lvl commands now properly show ranks based on account types</li>
<li>Plenty of new food types have been added to Item Stats plugin</li>

    <title>1.4.1 Release</title>
    <summary>Chat recolor, redwood tree markers, and grand exchange notifications</summary>
    <updated>2018-05-31T07:00:00.000Z</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Adam</name>
    </author>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <div><p>First, lately there have been several targeted phishing attacks against
RuneLite, including targeted ad buys on both Google and Reddit. If in doubt,
cross reference the site with the official GitHub and Discord. The main tell is
the official Windows download is an executable digitally signed by Alexander
Henne, and not a .jar. We can generally get these sites taken down, but it
usually takes some time to do so.</p>
<p>Now for the update:</p>
<p>Chat color for each chat type (public, private, clan, trade, etc.) are now
configurable in the “Chat Colors” configuratrion.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.4.1-Release/chatcolors.png" alt="chatcolors" /></p>
<p>The woodcutting plugin now can overlay redwood tree locations.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.4.1-Release/redwood.png" alt="redwood" /></p>
<p>The grand exchange plugin can now notify you when something buys or sells.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.4.1-Release/genotification.png" alt="genotification" /></p>
<p>Also a special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/sainttx">@Matthew Steglinski</a> who
contributed Javadoc for <a href="https://github.com/runelite/runelite/pull/3236">155
files</a> in the API. This greatly
improves our <a href="https://static.runelite.net/api/runelite-api/">published Javadoc</a>.</p>
<p>Screen markers can now be assigned names, making it easy to save and reuse them
later without having to re-add and position them. Existing screen markers will
need to be deleted and readded.</p>
<p>Full screen mode was added and is toggleable in RuneLite settings.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.4.1-Release/fullscreen.png" alt="fullscreen" /></p>
<p>There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix hiscore lookup autocomplete</li>
<li>Fix hiscore and GE lookups getting stuck when given invalid input</li>
<li>Improve boss timer spawn timers by start them when the NPC despawns instead of
at the beginning of the death animation</li>
<li>Add miscellaneous and scroll teleports to the world map plugin</li>
<li>Skill calculator now turns actions that will become available before target
level orange</li>
<li>The bank evaluator plugin now includes the price of untradeable items
tradeable versions</li>
<li>Optimize clickbox calculation code</li>
<li>Fix Vet’ion boss timer and add KQ boss timer</li>
<li>Add option to swap “interact” with “empty” on birdhouses</li>
<li>Update menu swapper to support multiple fairy ring defaults</li>
<li>Fix slayer plugin to work with NPC contact</li>
<li>Add Bandit Camp fishing spot to fishing plugin</li>
<li>Fix MLM plugin when it is started/stopped from within the MLM</li>
<li>Fix UI responsiveness when closing skill calculator</li>
<li>Add Limestone attack stone to skill calc</li>
<li>Reset gorillas in demonic gorilla plugin on startup and world hop</li>
<li>Add gilded altar to idle notifier</li>
<li>Add wine making to idle notifier</li>
<li>Add option to swap minecart menu option to travel from GE to Keldagrim</li>
<li>Add bar dispenser clickbox overlay to blast furnace plugin</li>
<li>Show clickbox of the Boiler in Dorgesh-Kaan agility course in the agility
plugin</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, there were clue fixes from Eadgars-Ruse, Jordan Atwood, and Maiddog.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

        <div><p>I have been given the go ahead to continue on with RuneLite development by MMK,
so here is release 1.3.9.</p>
<p>I have had to move most of my tools to be internal to
the project, and it is taking some time. We will probably be able to begin
accepting PRs again in full force sometime this weekend.</p>
<p>Hot/cold clue locations are now shown on the world map, and fairy ring teleport
icons now have a tooltip showing the fairy ring code. Contributed by
<a href="https://github.com/deathbeam">@deathbeam</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/MESLewis">@MESLewis</a> respectively.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.3.9-Release/hotcold.png" alt="hotcold" /></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Kruithne">@Kruithne</a> has added a skill calculator plugin.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.3.9-Release/skillcalc.png" alt="skillcalc" /></p>
<p>An anti-drag plugin has been added from
<a href="https://github.com/devdennis">@devdennis</a>. It lets you configure the “drag
delay” which can help prevent you from dragging items you meant to click on.</p>
<p>There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The opponent info plugin now displays approximate players hitpoints instead of
a percentage</li>
<li>Show GE and high alch prices on shop items when examined</li>
<li>Made existing config option for higlighting marks of grace also affect overlay
color</li>
<li>Add trap obstacles to agility plugin</li>
<li>Fix motherlode mine plugin when it is enabled when inside of the mine</li>
<li>Mitigate a rare crash in the official client at certain areas ingame</li>
<li>Add a tooltip font type configuration option</li>
<li>Auto complete hiscore lookups based on friends, clan members, and players</li>
</ul>
<p>Also thanks to trimbe, Shuhao Wu, Jordan Atwood, and Alex Kolpa for contributing
clue fixes.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <div><p>I have just finished speaking to MMK. I have agreed on a 1-2 day halt on
development pending further discussion, and I have closed sourced the
deobfuscator and the deobfuscated RuneScape client. RuneLite is allowed to
operate during this time.</p>
<p>The new OSBuddy API that has been announced is also a nice step forward. The two
clients become not too dissimilar at that point, both with a closed API
implementation.</p>
<p>What this means for developers is you must rely on our exposed API and are no
longer able to extend or modify it. This limits development some certainly but
it is what we must do.</p>
<p>The closed sourced components are both build-time and update-time tools, and are
not artifacts shipped to the end user. So, the level of difficulty required for
someone to independently prove that a given build of RuneLite is safe (eg. not
going to hack you) is approximately the same as before, and still certainly very
possible.</p>
<p>Hopefully it gets better from here…</p>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <div><p>First off, I would like to thank everyone in the community showing so much
support for RuneLite. What Jagex did was clearly a great injustice.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate the only way I seem to be able to have any meaningful
discussion with Jagex is via loud blog posts.</p>
<p>I have read the <a href="http://services.runescape.com/m=news/third-party-client-update?oldschool=1">Third Party Client
Update</a>
and it contains some new details to me. Specifically, the “sharing
of tools used to deobfuscate Old School RuneScape code, and then re-publishing
said code.”.</p>
<p>So, I have stripped the aforementioned tools and RuneScape client from GitHub. I
will be removing the other distributions off of the server shortly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this means now RuneLite will be only partially-open source.
RuneLite is BSD-2 licensed and the license permits me to do this. This will
hinder new contributions some in that they cannot learn of and create new APIs
for client access, but we already have a well established API which can be used
in the majority of cases.</p>
<p>I don’t really agree with some of the reasoning behind this, bots have existed
before RuneLite existed, and I’m sure some of them have a better knowledge of
the game than I do, but if it must be taken down, then okay.</p>
<p>Regarding “The conversation with RuneLite is part of the long-term strategy and
approach for all 3rd party clients and the future of our own official client.”,
as started in the initial post, I have no problem shutting down
RuneLite if all third party clients are to be shut down. But I will not shut it
down with the other clients still running.</p>
<p>Jagex, if you have objections to any other aspect of RuneLite, I would prefer if
you contacted me and told me about it, instead of threatening me to take down the
entire project. I have no problem working with you to address any concerns.</p>
<p>There is a large portion of RuneLite code that Jagex definitely has no claim over,
and it belongs to me, and to the many contributors to the project, and I think
it is wrong for you to claim it must all be removed.</p>

by the end of the week.</p>
<p>I inquired specifically what parts of RuneLite violate Jagex’s copyright so that
I could take it down, and even offered to close source the project, but MMK
insisted that the entire project must be shut down, and gave no specifics about
the copyright infringement claims, and only said legal action would be taken.</p>
<p>I was also informed that they were “working on” shutting down both OSB and
Konduit, and that I was the “first” to be contacted.</p>
<p>RuneLite is certainly in a grey area to my knowledge of copyright law. I have no
issue working with Jagex to remove parts of it from the public eye if requested.
I would also have no issue shutting down the entire client if all 3rd party
clients were banned. However, I do have an issue with shutting down the entire
client while OSBuddy is allowed to operate.</p>
<p>While I agree that RuneLite does threaten the integrity of the game, what
threatens it even more is that I have to <em>buy</em> OSBuddy in order to gain the same
competitive advantages of other players in game. RuneLite exists to try and
level the playing field as to who can develop on the client, of which I think it
has done well.</p>
<p>Jagex, please work with me here instead of singling us out. We love the game,
and have great respect for you, but this is not an acceptable way of dealing
with the third party clients.</p>
<p>If anyone within the community happens to be a (copyright) lawyer, please
contact me.</p>
<p>- Adam</p>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <div><p>A tile marker plugin has been added which allows you to highlight arbitrary
tiles by holding shift and selecting “Mark”. The markers are saved with your
client settings, and work even in instances.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.3.6-Release/tilemarker.gif" alt="tilemarker" /></p>
<p>Agility shortcuts throughout the game are now highlighted, and the agility
plugin now highlights marks of grace:</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.3.6-Release/agilityshortcut.png" alt="agilityshortcut" /></p>
<p>A fairy ring location plugin was added which tells you the location fairy rings
are configured to:</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.3.6-Release/fairyring.png" alt="fairyring" /></p>
<p>An entity hider plugin was added which lets you hide other players and npcs from
view.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.3.6-Release/entityhider.png" alt="entityhider" /></p>
<p>There has been a large effort to fix and correct all of the clues from the
cluescroll plugin. I expect a few more releases before it is solid, but it
should no longer point at random objects anymore.</p>
<p>There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opponent info should no longer sometimes show “null” for opponent name</li>
<li>The infoboxes now have a configurable wrap limit, and can be configured to
stack verically instead.</li>
<li>Support for slayer braclets have been added to the slayer plugin</li>
<li>The MLM plugin now only shows veins on the same floor as you are</li>
<li>Fix notes plugin to textwrap</li>
<li>Add kingdom of misc. to screenshot plugin</li>
<li>The length XP globes are shown is now configurable</li>
<li>Fix client resizing itself when the plugin panel is collapsed and the client
is maximized</li>
<li>Color HP xp drops when praying too if XP drops are split</li>
<li>“Actions Left” has been added to XP globes</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <div><p>Animation smoothing is here to showcase the bleeding edge of oldschool visuals.
Players, NPCs, and environmental objects can now be interpolated (or ‘tweened’)
to animate at higher framerates. Thanks to
<a href="https://github.com/DevDennis">@DevDennis</a> for bringing this eye candy to life.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.3.4-Release/animsmoothing1.gif" alt="animsmoothing1" />
<img src="/img/blog/1.3.4-Release/animsmoothing2.gif" alt="animsmoothing2" />
<img src="/img/blog/1.3.4-Release/animsmoothing3.gif" alt="animsmoothing3" /></p>
<p>HiScore lookups can now be accessed from many more right-click menus, including
in the chatbox, your friends list, from private messages, in the clan chat
sidebar, and on the raiding party menu (for members with at least a kick-rank).
<a href="https://github.com/Kamielvf">@Kamielvf</a> worked on this quality of life change,
big thanks to him.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.3.4-Release/lookups.png" alt="lookups" /></p>
<p>The Dark Mage in the Abyss can now be highlighted whenever your inventory
contains a degraded pouch in need of repairs. Props to
<a href="https://github.com/jaeger25">@jaeger25</a> for looking after our forgetful
runecrafters.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.3.4-Release/darkmage.png" alt="darkmage" /></p>
<p>There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added healing values for 30+ missing foods; most importantly, easter eggs!</li>
<li>Menu entry swapper: updated the Travel option to include balloons and
Fremennik boats, and added a new Chase option for cats who love rat-hunting.
Pickpocket swapping is now limited to H.A.M. members only, due to unintended
thieving balance issues (eg. with blackjacking).</li>
<li>Removed the Pyramid Plunder plugin because
<a href="http://services.runescape.com/m=news/quality-of-life-improvements?oldschool=1">we don’t need it any more</a>.
Good Jagex.</li>
<li>Renamed the Attack Indicators plugin to Attack Styles, and added better
control over when the indicator appears.</li>
<li>Added a toggle for displaying skilling session stats.</li>
<li>Updated our overlay text to use the current oldschool font, complete with
slashed 0’s.</li>
<li>Fixed several clue scroll helpers which pointed to wrong spots, suggested
the wrong dance emote, or contained typos.</li>
<li>Hunter plugin: fix bug related to setting traps and walking in the same tick.</li>
<li>Fixed report button not returning to normal when the plugin was disabled.</li>
<li>Fixed the bank tag search forgetting to match item placeholders.</li>
<li>Fixed the screenshot plugin crashing on certain dialogs, like grabbing a
hammer from a Motherlode crate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

    <summary>Movable overlays, revamped clue scoll plugin, and tithe farm plugin</summary>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <div><p>Movable overlay support is finally here! This allows you to move any RuneLite
Overlay to any position on the screen. Hold alt to do so. There are 4 (or 5 on
resizable) “snap corners” provided where, if you move an overlay to a snap
corner, the client will dynamically place the overlay to not draw on top of
other overlays. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/deathbeam">@deathbeam</a> for this
feature.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.3.2-Release/overlays.gif" alt="overlay" /></p>
<p>The clue scroll plugin has been rewritten, and now supports all clue types.
Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/devlotto">@devLotto</a> for their work on this.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.3.2-Release/clue1.png" alt="clue1" />
<img src="/img/blog/1.3.2-Release/clue2.png" alt="clue2" /></p>
<p>A tithe farm plugin was added by <a href="https://github.com/unmoon">@Unmoon</a>, which tracks plant growth stages and state.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.3.2-Release/tithe.png" alt="tithe" /></p>
<p>The agility plugin now has an additional lap counter overlay by <a href="https://github.com/sethtroll">@sethtroll</a>:</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.3.2-Release/agility.png" alt="agility" /></p>
<p>There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The instance map plugin maps now look the same as the ingame minimap</li>
<li>Mouse tooltips were moved to the bottom right corner of the mouse, and are now
hidden when the game has a tooltip open.</li>
<li>Fixed slayer points and streak being lost on restart</li>
<li>A kingdom of Miscellania plugin has been added to show you your support, and
optionally warn if it is unpopular</li>

        <div><p>A prayer reordering plugin has been added which lets you reorder the prayers in
your prayer book. Big thanks to <a href="https://github.com/devdennis">@devdennis</a> for

<p>A bank evaluator has been added, which is a combination of effort from myself,
<a href="https://github.com/jplsek">@jplsek</a>, and

GE and HA price of each tab of your bank.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.3.1-Release/bank-eval.png" alt="bankval" /></p>

of items when hovered over in the bank.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.3.1-Release/itemprice.png" alt="itemprice" /></p>
<p>There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ground items now support wildcards in both hidden and highlighted fields, so for example <code>*bone*</code>
will hide/highlight all bones</li>
<li>The boosted stats plugin now shows time until next change</li>
<li>The agility plugin allows configuring of the hitbox overlay color</li>
<li>Game menus options are no longer left broken when moving regions with the menu
option</li>

<li>Common cannon placement spots have been added to the cannon plugin</li>

<li>Removed background from the prayer flick overlay, which made the quick prayers
 toggle hard to see</li>

<li>The slayer plugin infobox (with your current task) now has a configurable

        <div><p>This release includes several notable features, including:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/UniquePassive">@UniquePassive</a> added a screenshot plugin,
overlay layers, which automatically takes a screen shot on level up, clue
completion, and quest completion. The screenshots may optionally be
automatically uploaded to imgur.</p>

<p><img src="/img/blog/1.2.13-Release/screenshotplugin.png" alt="screenshot-plugin" /></p>

from Jagex.</p>

    <summary>New 1.2.11 release of RuneLite is out. Notable new features are an awesome Hunter Plugin and support for more potion timers</summary>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <div><p>In this release we made a lot of improvements to client source, performance and
overall stability of the client. But there are few new features that are
definitely worth mentioning.</p>
<p>First, and the biggest one is <strong>Hunter</strong> plugin (thanks to
<a href="https://github.com/RobinWeymans">@RobinWeymans</a>). Hunter plugin will show you
state of your traps and also time until they will break. That should improve
your overall hunting experience (and makes the terrible skill less terrible).
Here is small preview:</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.2.11-Release/hunterplugin.png" alt="hunter-plugin" /></p>
<p>We also added support for some missing potions for the <strong>Timers</strong> plugin, and that
also includes the newest released potion, Super Antifire Potion.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.2.11-Release/newtimers.png" alt="newtimers" /></p>
<p>And last feature on the list is support for <strong>native window decorations</strong>. That
means now you have option to let your window manager handle the window
decorations (title bar, window borders). Here is small preview using my window
manager (bspwm) without any window borders:</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.2.11-Release/nativewindow.png" alt="native-window" /></p>
<p>As I said in the beginning of the post, we made a lot of improvements to the
client source code (mainly decoupling), so if you are bored Java developer
looking for project to contribute to, you are always welcome!</p>
<p>Hopefully you will like the new release, enjoy!</p>

    <summary>New 1.2.10 release of RuneLite is out. We added many new features, like native UI, notifications and few plugin improvements.</summary>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <div><p>This release adds lots of new functionality to RuneLite to make the end-user
experience even better, and to compete with well established third-party
clients.</p>
<p>The most notable new feature is the <strong>new UI design</strong>. I tried to make it look as
close to the native OSRS interfaces as possible. Here is the end result:</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.2.10-Release/native-ui.png" alt="native ui" /></p>
<p>The UI was updated for all of the current RuneLite plugins, and the new API for
it is really easy to use, so it can be used in future plugins too. An example
of plugin using the new UI api is the new <strong>Team Capes</strong> plugin.</p>
<p>The plugin is showing the amount of players wearing specific team capes
currently visible on the map, which is very useful for pking clans. Here is how
it looks in game:</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.2.10-Release/team-cape.png" alt="team capes plugin" /></p>
<p>Till now it was hard to check the price of item you just got as a drop
from monster, or just simply to check price of stack of your precious magic
logs in bank. That is why there were quite a few improvements to examine plugin
in the client. Now you are able to examine items and item stacks in you bank,
inventory, equipment screen or even in the Miscellania screen and it shows
Grand Exchange and High Alchemy price of that item in the game chat. Here is
small example:</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.2.10-Release/examine-plugin.png" alt="examine plugin" /></p>
<p>To make talking to your clan mates easier, there is new clan chat plugin
that shows current ranks of every clan chat member next to his/her name.
Example:</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.2.10-Release/clan-chat.png" alt="clan chat plugin" /></p>
<p>There were also some background changes in the client to make it work better,
fix some bugs and possibly make it faster. One of the background improvements
that is also visible to end users is the use of the native notification system,
so it now supports every Linux distribution with working notification system
and even Mac OS (with same notification support for Windows as before). Example
of the notification system in action on Arch Linux with Dunst notification
daemon:</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/1.2.10-Release/native-notifications.png" alt="native notifications" /></p>
<p>Well, hopefully you like new release, and as usual, enjoy!</p>
